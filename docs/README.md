# Carbon Sensors Simulation using ns-3

This repository contains two ns-3 scenarios modeling an IoT carbon trading platform:

- Single-tier WiFi network (10 sensors -> 1 gateway)
- Hierarchical network (5 WiFi zones with 2 sensors each -> 5 APs -> 1 main gateway via CSMA)

Outputs include NetAnim XML, FlowMonitor XML, PCAPs, and Python visualizations.

See the top-level README for build and run instructions.
